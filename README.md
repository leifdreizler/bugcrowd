# Bugcrowd
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leifdreizler/bugcrowd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leifdreizler/bugcrowd)[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/bugcrowd.svg)]()

Python wrapper for the [Bugcrowd API](https://docs.bugcrowd.com/docs/authentication) by [Leif Dreizler](https://twitter.com/leifdreizler) and [Zach Sperske](https://twitter.com/zsperske). Leif does work at Bugcrowd, but this isn't an official Bugcrowd integration.

This was our first Python module, so beware! ðŸ‘»

## Installation

`$ pip install bugcrowd`

## Examples

We have included a few examples in the `examples` folder, and plan to add more in the future. In the meantime you should visit the tests folder and review the test cases for usage.

## What's Missing

Need tests for:
- Create submission
- Update status
- Submission rewards
